# Introduction

Our vehicle inventory system concept was born out of our experience as international students in the USA. Being from India, we often found it difficult to understand the vehicle market in a new country, especially when it came to recognizing different car brands and models. This challenge inspired us to create a platform that allows users to compare car brands from both the USA and India easily. Our project centers around developing a system that manages and tracks data for 4-wheeler vehicles produced between the years 2010 and 2024.

One of the standout features of this platform is that it showcases car brands from both India and the USA. This will allow users to view and compare models from both regions. This feature is designed specifically to help individuals like us, who may not be familiar with the vehicle market in a foreign country, yet wish to make informed comparisons to vehicles from their home country. Each brandâ€™s page will include details on models released during different years, including key specifications. This information will assist users in making confident choices, even if they are new to the car market in another country.

We wanted to create a solution that would help others who face similar challenges in making informed vehicle purchases. With this platform, students and users like us can easily explore vehicle options from the USA and India, allowing them to make thoughtful comparisons and decisions based on reliable data.

# Anticipated Technologies

We would be using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & SQL to achieve this project.

# Method/Approach

1. Gathering Data
Approach: Collect detailed data about 4-wheeler vehicles from 2000 to 2024, including car brands, models, specifications, and features. Data can be sourced from manufacturer databases, online vehicle catalogs, or public vehicle databases. Information will be in structured database like MySQL for easy access and retrieval.

2. Create a Homepage
Approach: We will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design an user-friendly homepage. Page will serve as showcasing the platform's features, vehicle comparisons and search functionality. Responsive design techniques will ensure compatibility across various devices.

3. Individual Pages for Different Brands of Cars
Approach: Dynamically generate individual pages for each car brand using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page will include details of models from 2000 to 2024, allowing users to explore car specifications interactively.

4. Build a Comparison Page for Vehicles
Approach: Use JavaScript (React or Angular) to build an interactive comparison tool that allows users to select multiple cars and view them side by side. An API will retrieve vehicle details and perform comparisons on various specifications. User experience will be prioritized for easy navigation and feature clarity.

5. Build Search and Filter Functionalities
Approach: Implement advanced search and filtering options using JavaScript to fetch data dynamically from the database. Filters will allow users to search by brand, year, specifications, and price range.

6. Perform Encryption on User Data
Approach: Ensure user data security by implementing encryption protocols using HTTPS and SSL/TLS for data in transit.

# Estimated Timeline

The milestones for this project would be to gather information related to different cars, create a Home page and then create individual pages for different brands of cars. To create another page to perform comparison between vehicles, To build search and filter functionalities, to perform encryption on data.

1. Gathering cars related data (2 weeks)
2. Create Home Page & Individual web pages containing different cars information (3 weeks)
3. To add comparison feature for the webpage( 1 weeks)
4. To add search and filter functionalities (2 weeks)
5. To ensure that the data is encrypted (1 week)

# Anticipated Problems

1. Data Accuracy: Ensure vehicle data is always current and accurate, including updates for new models.

2. Safeguarding User Privacy and Data Security: To securely store and transfer users' personal information, we'll use modern methods of encryption, to ensure it remains secure from possible breaches.

3. Language Alternatives: We're going to provide a number of language options and make sure those who have problems are able to utilize the website with the aim to make this platform available to all.

4. Device Compatibility: The platform will be designed work easily on any platform, be it a smartphone, tablet, or desktop, ensuring an excellent user experience regardless of the device the user is using.

5. Managing User Feedback: Implement a system to moderate reviews and address user feedback constructively to maintain credibility.
