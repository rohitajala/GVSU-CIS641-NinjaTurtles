# Software Requirement Specification 

## Overview
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document shows the functional & non-functional requirements for our Vehicle Inventory Webpage (CarChoice). Our webpage will be built based on the requirements outlined below. This document will help us stay on track and reduce scope creep. This can also serve as a part of documentation which will help future developers who would become a part of this project to gain more insights on the project's status.
