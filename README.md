# GVSU-CIS641-NinjaTurtles

# Project description

The vehicle inventory system was inspired by the experience of being international students in the USA, struggling to understand the vehicle market. The platform helps users easily compare car brands from both the USA and India, focusing on 4-wheelers produced between 2010 and 2024. It provides a side-by-side comparison of car models, including specifications and details for informed decision-making. The platform aims to assist users unfamiliar with the vehicle market in a foreign country to make confident vehicle purchaseÂ choices..

2. Project Structure:
   - HTML Files:
     - `index.html`: The homepage where users can start their journey.
     - `compare.html`: Allows users to select and compare two cars based on various criteria.
     - `brand.html`: Displays car brands and their respective models.
   - CSS Files: Located in the `/assets` folder to style the entire application.
   - JavaScript Files: Located in `/assets/js` where all hardcoded car data and comparison logic reside.
